/**
 * 10.- üë©‚Äçüíª The elfish assembler
 * The elf programmers are creating a small magical assembler to control the machines in Santa Claus's workshop.
 *
 * To assist them, we will implement a simple interpreter that supports the following magical instructions:
 * - MOV x y: Copies the value x (which can be a number or the content of a register) into register y
 * - INC x: Increments the content of register x by 1
 * - DEC x: Decrements the content of register x by 1
 * - JMP x y: If the value in register x is 0, then jumps to the instruction at index y and continues executing the program from there.
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - If an attempt is made to access, increment, or decrement a register that has not been initialized, the default value 0 will be used.
 * - The jump with JMP is absolute and goes to the exact index indicated by y.
 * - Upon completion, the program should return the content of register A. If A did not have a defined value, it returns undefined.
