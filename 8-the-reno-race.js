/**
 * 8.- ðŸ¦Œ The reno race
 * It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
 * Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.
 *
 * Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.
 *
 * The information you receive:
 * - indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
 * - 0: The lane is empty.
 * - Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
 * - Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
 * - length: The length of each lane.
 *
 * Return a string representing the race track:
 * - Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
 * - Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
 * - Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
 * - The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.
