/**
 * 18.- ðŸ“‡ Santa's Magic Agenda
 * Santa Claus has a magic diary ðŸ“‡ where he keeps the addresses of the children to deliver the presents.
 * The problem: the diary's information is mixed and misformatted.
 * The lines contain a magic phone number, a child's name, and their address, but everything is surrounded by strange characters.
 *
 * Santa needs your help to find specific information from the diary. Write a function that, given the diary's content and a phone number, returns the child's name and address.
 *
 * Keep in mind that in the diary:
 * - Phone numbers are formatted as +X-YYY-YYY-YYY (where X is one or two digits, and Y is a digit).
 * - Each child's name is always between < and >
 *
 * The idea is for you to write a function that, given the full phone number or part of it, returns the child's name and address.
 * If it doesn't find anything or there is more than one result, you must return null.
