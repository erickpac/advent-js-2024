/**
 * 3.- Organizing the inventory
 * Santa Claus ðŸŽ… is checking his workshop inventory to prepare gift delivery.
 * The elves have recorded the toys in an array of objects, but the information
 * is a bit disorganized. You need to help Santa organize the inventory.
 *
 * You will receive an array of objects, where each object represents a toy and has the properties:
 * - name: the name of the toy (string).
 * - quantity: the available quantity of that toy (integer).
 * - category: the category to which the toy belongs (string).
 *
 * Write a function that processes this array and returns an object that organizes the toys as follows:
 * - The keys of the object will be the categories of toys.
 * - The values will be objects that have the toy names as keys and the total quantities of each toy in that category as values.
 * - If there are toys with the same name in the same category, you must sum their quantities.
 * - If the array is empty, the function should return an empty object {}.
